Explanation:
Redis: Acts as a caching layer and also helps with storing the last processed binlog position to ensure data consistency.
Kafka: Functions as the message broker. The producer will send messages to Kafka, and consumers (which could be Laravel jobs) will process these messages asynchronously and write them into ClickHouse.
Zookeeper: Required by Kafka to manage and coordinate distributed brokers.
Steps in the Process:
Producer:

The producer reads the binlog from MySQL.
It sends the data to the Kafka broker.
It updates Redis with the latest binlog position after each successful operation to ensure no data is lost or duplicated.
Kafka:

Receives data from the producer and distributes it to different topics, which consumers subscribe to.
Consumer:

Laravel jobs or workers consume the messages from Kafka topics.
These consumers process the data (e.g., transforming it) and insert it into ClickHouse for fast querying and analytics.
ClickHouse:

Stores the processed data in a schema optimized for fast read operations.
Redis (Caching):

Stores the last processed binlog position to ensure data consistency between MySQL and ClickHouse.
MySQL (Session Storage):

Used as the primary database for transactional data and session management within Laravel.
